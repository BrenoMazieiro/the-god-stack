# The God Stack Starter - Docker Graphql Nodejs React and Apollo

This is a boilerplate! =)

The name GodStack is a joke with the fullStack idea (Front+back)

GodStack should be something like (DBA+Devops+back+front)... maybe more... why not? ;)

## Devops instructions

You gonna need docker and docker-compose on your machine!

#### Docker: https://docs.docker.com/install/

Every distro has its own way to install docker:

- Fedora: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/
- Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
- Mac: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

Just find yours googling: docker install < DISTRO NAME >

#### docker-compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

## Database instructions

Databases available in this project at the moment:
- Mariadb (as a docker container)
- Postgres (soon)
- MongoDb (soon)
- Neo4j (soon)

## BackEnd instructions

**Pattern**: Domain Driven Design (DDD)

More about it: https://bit.ly/2O14Ddp (it will download a pdf)

This is not an Rest API, it is an GraphQl, so there is NO routes, just Qls. (Keep that in your mind!)

Any doubts abou the qls? just go to: https://graphql.org/

Apollo server: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/

## FrontEnd instructions

**Pattern**: Atomic Design

More about it: https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/

Apollo Client will take care of this things for us, this is why we are not using redux or axios.
And we are using hooks.

Any Doubts go to:
- Apollo Client: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/
- Hooks: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
- React: https://reactjs.org/
- Atomic Design: https://github.com/diegohaz/arc

## Install Instructions - Lets do IT!

###  **STEP 1 - Soul preparation**

Grab a beer, wine or juice, because it is just an automated task. =)

###  **STEP 2 - Devops (this may take a bit to complete!)**

####  Build nodejs image (depending on your hardware this may take a while, be **patient!**):

With docker and docker-compose installed jut go to the **ROOT** project folder:

`docker build -t thegodstack-nodejs-knex registry-thegodstack/nodejs-knex`

#### **STEP 3 - Changing your hosts (MAC AND LINUX)   ==> (MANDATORY) <==**
You need to go to your **/etc/hosts** file and ADD the lines below:  
```
127.0.0.1   proxy.local.thegodstack.com 
127.0.0.1   mariadb.local.thegodstack.com
127.0.0.1   api.local.thegodstack.com
127.0.0.1   spa.local.thegodstack.com
```

Now it will be possible to use a real full address, and not the old (and lame) **'localhost:port'**

P.S.: There is an hosts file on windows aswell, but I do not know where, try google! =)

###  **STEP 4 - Starting everything!**

Creating database:

- MariaDb:  
`docker-compose up -d mariadb && sleep 20s && docker exec -it mariadb.local.thegodstack.com /bin/sh -c "mysql -uroot -pthegodstackpass -hlocalhost -e 'CREATE DATABASE thegodstack'"`

Starting everything:

`docker-compose up`

### **STEP 5 - Seeding**

`docker exec -it api.local.thegodstack.com yarn seedDb`

### **STEP 6 - Access Urls**

* API: api.local.thegodstack.com
* SPA: spa.local.thegodstack.com

### **STEP 7 - Running Test**

* BackEnd (soon): `docker exec -it api.local.thegodstack.com yarn test`
* FrontEnd: `docker exec -it spa.local.thegodstack.com yarn test`

### **Step 8 - Insomnia (GraphQl)**

We are using GraphQl so Postman is not a good call, but we have insomnia to help us:

Download it here: https://insomnia.rest/download/

If you are using any kind of Linux that is not Ubuntu I strongly recomend to Download the AppImage package.

Here: https://github.com/getinsomnia/insomnia/releases/

ex: Insomnia-7.0.3.AppImage or Insomnia-<LAST_VERSION>.AppImage

Open insomnia and import the confs from: api/docs


## **Extra Info**

As you can figure it out by docker-compose.yml, there is this variables
  - ADMIN_NAME: "Breno Mazieiro"
  - ADMIN_EMAIL: "admin@thegodstack.com"
  - ADMIN_PASS: "thegodstack"

It will be used on seeding!
